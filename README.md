``Flutter Installer Windows``.
======================================================================
*One command for automated minimal flutter installation*


Isn't it awesome you follow procedurce mentioned on flutter.dev and still things doesn't work.

*Hell no!*  You know what's awesome?  It's when you simply run one script and 
all latest version get installed for *Flutter*, *Adopt OpenJDK8* and *Android SDK* 
without Android Studio or emulator to eat your RAM. :p

**How to use?**
======================================================================
*prerequisites: Git and Powershell 5+*

- Clone or download this repository
- Run the script :p

        powershell.exe -ep Bypass -File "flutter-installer.ps1"


Great Thanks to Flutter, AdoptOpenJDK to make this script possible.
